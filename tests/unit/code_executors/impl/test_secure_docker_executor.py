# TODO P1: Add comprehensive tests once SecureDockerExecutor is fully implemented.
# These tests would mock the Docker SDK interactions to verify:
# - Correct Docker image selection based on language.
# - Secure container creation with resource limits and volume mounts (if any).
# - Code and input_data transfer to the container.
# - Stdout/stderr capture from the container.
# - Timeout enforcement (e.g., container.wait(timeout=...)).
# - Container cleanup (removal) after execution.
# - Handling of Docker errors (daemon unavailable, image not found, container run errors).
# - Handling of non-zero exit codes from the code executed in the container.
